# Synthetix-Contract-Review

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive review of the Synthetix Collateral Manager smart contract. This is aimed at conducting analysis of the contract functionality, identifying potential vulnerabilities. This covers aspects like security checks and gas optimization.

## Features
- **Automated Security Checks**: Run static analysis tools to detect common vulnerabilities.
- **Code Quality Review**: Evaluate the readability, structure, and maintainability of the contract code.
- **Gas Optimization Suggestions**: Identify potential gas-saving improvements.

## Prerequisites
To conduct the analysis, the following tools were used:
- **Node.js**
- **npm** for package management
- **Foundry**
- **Slither:** A static analytic tools for scanning contract vulnerabilities


## Project Structure
- `contracts/`: Contains the Solidity contracts to be reviewed.
- `static_analysis/`: Scripts and configuration for running static analysis tools.
- `Contract -Review/`: Documentation of the contract review.
